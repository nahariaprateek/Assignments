In this homework fit and select a classifier to predict credit card default using `default_of_credit_card_clients` dataset from BlackBoard course site. The data description is available at : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jishnukoliyadan/taiwan-default-credit-card-clients

1. Explore (5+5+10=20 points)
  1. load the dataset. Use only the columns "LIMIT_BAL", "SEX", "EDUCATION", "MARRIAGE", and "AGE" among predictors. The target is "default payment next month". 
  1. identify the categorical features (with brief explanation), and 
  1. produce the pairwise scatter plot only for the numeric variables. 
1. Prepare a pipeline to (30 points)
  1. standardize the numeric attributes
  1. expand the categorical attributes to columns of 0/1 variables
  1. fit a `RandomForestClassifier` classifier
1. Search over the `max_depth` and `min_samples_leaf` parameters to find the best model per **balanced accuracy** metric. Use at least three different search strategies and discuss any differences you see in the results. (20 points)
1. Let's assume that the cost of missing a default (i.e., predicting non-default for a customer who ended up defaulting) is 10 times the cost of flagging a non-defaulter as defaulter. Let's further assume that the cost of correct predictions are 0. Use any one of the search strategies considered in the previous question to find the `RandomForestClassifier` that minimizes the cost. (20 points)
1. Collaboration statement: Who did you discuss while answering this homework (whether to get or to provide help)? What questions/topics did you discuss? (10 points)

Note: No penalty for either side. While getting help in figuring out how to solve is OK, all answers should be produced by you.
